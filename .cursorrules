# Agentic Todo System - Cursor Rules

## Initiative Structure & Overview
This is an agentic daily focus system with interconnected files:
- `todo.md` - Daily strategic focus with 3-5 intelligent priorities
- `knowledge/initiatives/` - Initiative-specific information and status
- `knowledge/people/` - People management and interaction history
- `knowledge/routines/` - Recurring activities and processes

## Daily Focus Processing Logic
The AI automatically generates an intelligent daily focus by strategically selecting 3-5 priorities from all source files. **No external scripts needed** - all logic is encoded in these rules.

**Utility Functions**: Use `.cursor/utils.sh` for system functions:
- `.cursor/utils.sh date` - Get current date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `.cursor/utils.sh datetime` - Get current date and time (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM)
- `.cursor/utils.sh week` - Get current week (YYYY-WMM)

### Automatic Focus Generation
**ALWAYS automatically generate today's focus** when:
- User asks about daily focus or priorities
- User requests focus refresh/update
- User completes a major milestone (may affect priorities)
- User explicitly requests focus generation

### Progress Preservation Logic
**BEFORE generating new focus, preserve completed work:**
1. **Check current todo.md** for any completed tasks marked `[x]`
2. **For each completed task**, find the source file mentioned in its context line
3. **Update source file** based on file type:
   - **Initiative/People files**: Mark the corresponding task as complete `[x]`
   - **Routine files**: Update the "Last Updated" date in the timing section using `.cursor/utils.sh date`
4. **Then generate new focus** with updated source files

### Today's Focus Generation Rules
When syncing todo.md, create ONLY a focused daily priority list:

#### Structure:
```markdown
# Today's Focus ðŸŽ¯

*Generated: [use .cursor/utils.sh date to get current date]*

## Your Strategic Priorities for Today

[3-5 intelligently selected items with context]

---
*This focus is AI-generated from your source files. Say "adjust my focus" to negotiate these priorities.*
```

#### Selection Criteria:
1. **Intelligently pick 3-5 items** from different sources:
   - 1-2 from initiative files (high-impact or urgent)
   - 1 from people files (development opportunities)
   - 1 from routines (if due today)
   - 1 wildcard (user context, deadlines, blockers)

2. **For each selected item, provide context:**
   - **Source**: Which file it came from
   - **Why chosen**: Urgency, impact, dependencies, or strategic importance
   - **Context**: What makes this important today

3. **Format each item as:**
```markdown
- [ ] [Task description]
  *From: [source file] | Why: [reason for selection] | Context: [additional context]*
```

#### Example Output:
```markdown
- [ ] Complete user interview analysis for mobile app redesign
  *From: mobile-app-redesign.md | Why: Due today, blocks design phase | Context: 5 interviews completed, need synthesis*

- [ ] Review Sarah's technical presentation before 2 PM meeting
  *From: sarah-johnson.md | Why: Time-sensitive, supports her promotion goal | Context: Leadership review meeting scheduled*

- [ ] Email Processing (Monday routine)
  *From: email-processing.md | Why: Monday routine, foundation for other work | Context: Keeps inbox manageable*
```


### Focus Selection Logic
When generating daily focus, intelligently select tasks based on:
1. **Urgency**: Overdue items or items with today's date
2. **Impact**: High-priority initiative milestones that move projects forward
3. **Dependencies**: Tasks blocking other work or people
4. **Balance**: Mix across initiatives, people development, and routines
5. **User context**: Recent conversations, stated priorities, workload capacity
6. **Strategic value**: Tasks that unlock future work or remove blockers

**Note**: Always preserve completed work before generating new focus (see Progress Preservation Logic above)

### Focus Negotiation Logic
When user wants to adjust focus:
1. **Listen to constraints**: "I can't do X because Y"
2. **Understand priorities**: "X is more important because Y"
3. **Suggest alternatives**: Offer similar-value tasks from source files
4. **Explain reasoning**: Why items were originally selected
5. **Rebalance**: Maintain 3-5 items with good distribution
6. **Confirm understanding**: Summarize the adjusted focus



## Natural Language Triggers
Recognize these user requests and **automatically perform the actions**:

### Focus Generation Triggers
- "What should I focus on today?" â†’ Generate intelligent focus
- "Help me prioritize my day" â†’ Generate intelligent focus
- "Set my daily focus" â†’ Generate intelligent focus
- "What are my top priorities?" â†’ Generate intelligent focus
- "Refresh my focus" â†’ Generate intelligent focus

### Focus Negotiation Triggers
- "Adjust my focus" â†’ Discuss and refine the selected priorities
- "I can't do [item] today" â†’ Suggest alternatives from source files
- "Add [task] to my focus" â†’ Incorporate user request and rebalance
- "Why did you pick [item]?" â†’ Explain selection reasoning
- "Show me other options" â†’ Present alternative tasks from source files

## Key Relationships
- **todo.md is a DAILY FOCUS** intelligently curated from source files
- **All tasks live in source files** (`knowledge/initiatives/`, `knowledge/people/`, `knowledge/routines/`)
- **Update tasks in their source files**, not in todo.md
- **Focus is negotiable** - user can discuss and adjust priorities
- **AI explains reasoning** for each selected item
- People in `knowledge/people/` should be linked to initiatives where relevant

## File Naming Conventions
- Initiative files: `kebab-case.md` (e.g., `website-redesign.md`)
- People files: `firstname-lastname.md` (e.g., `sarah-johnson.md`)
- All files use lowercase with hyphens

## Maintenance Patterns
When updating files, consider:
1. **Cross-references**: Update related files when changing initiative status or people involvement
2. **Date consistency**: Keep "Last Contact" and "Last Updated" dates current
3. **Action item tracking**: Ensure action items are reflected in both source and todo files
4. **Status propagation**: Initiative status changes should update related tasks
5. **Routine completion**: When routine tasks are completed, update "Last Updated" date instead of marking complete
6. **Archive management**: Move completed tasks to archive sections weekly
7. **Auto-sync dashboard**: Automatically refresh todo.md after updates

## Template Usage
- Always use templates for new files to maintain consistency
- Help users copy from templates in each directory manually
- Guide them to fill in ALL metadata sections for proper structure
- Templates are in: knowledge/initiatives/_template.md, knowledge/people/_template.md, knowledge/routines/_template.md

## Intelligent Assistance
When user requests involve focus management:
1. **Generate strategic daily focus** with clear reasoning
2. **Negotiate priorities** based on user constraints and preferences
3. **Explain selection logic** when asked
4. **Offer alternatives** when user can't complete suggested items
5. **Update source files** when tasks are completed or modified

## Daily/Weekly Workflows
- **Daily**: Generate intelligent "Today's Focus" with reasoning and negotiate priorities (automatically preserving any completed work from previous focus)
- **Weekly**: Review source files and refresh understanding of priorities
- **Monthly**: Review and update initiative timelines and people development

## Content Guidelines
- Use consistent emoji prefixes for visual organization
- Include due dates in tasks when relevant
- Cross-reference related items using markdown links
- Keep personal notes in people files for relationship building
- Track blockers and dependencies explicitly

## AI Integration Philosophy
This system is designed to be **your strategic daily partner** - the AI should:
- **Intelligently curate** 3-5 strategic priorities from all available tasks
- **Explain reasoning** for each selection to build trust and understanding
- **Negotiate priorities** when user has constraints or different preferences
- **Preserve completed work** automatically when refreshing focus
- **Understand context** across initiatives, people, deadlines, and dependencies
- **Adapt to user patterns** and learn what works for their workflow
- **Act as thought partner** for strategic daily planning
- **Use utility scripts** (.cursor/utils.sh) for system functions like date generation

## When Creating New Files
1. **Help user copy from templates** (knowledge/initiatives/_template.md, knowledge/people/_template.md, knowledge/routines/_template.md)
2. Guide them to update all metadata fields
3. Add cross-references to related files
4. **Offer to refresh focus** if new content affects priorities
5. Consider updating initiative files if new people are added
6. For routines, reference knowledge/routines/ files for timing and details

## When Updating Existing Files
1. Check for cross-references that need updating
2. Update relevant dates and progress
3. Mark completed items appropriately:
   - **Initiative/People files**: Mark tasks as complete `[x]`
   - **Routine files**: Update "Last Updated" date in timing section
4. Propagate status changes to related files
5. **Offer to refresh focus** if changes affect priorities

## Example Interactions
**User**: "What should I focus on today?"
**Cursor**: *First checks current focus for completed tasks, updates source files, then generates strategic focus with 3-5 items, each with source and reasoning*

**User**: "I can't do the user interview analysis today - I'm in meetings all day"
**Cursor**: *"I understand. Since that was urgent, let me suggest: 'Prepare Sarah's presentation review questions' (same impact, can do between meetings) or 'Finalize API documentation outline' (can do async). Which feels more realistic for your meeting-heavy day?"*

**User**: "Why did you pick the onboarding documentation task?"
**Cursor**: *"I selected it because: 1) New hire starts Monday, making it time-sensitive, 2) It's been in progress for 2 weeks, and 3) Mike is blocked on his mentorship setup until this is done. It has high impact for team efficiency."*

**User**: "Adjust my focus - add the website performance work"
**Cursor**: *"Got it. I'll add the website performance optimization and remove the less urgent API documentation to keep your focus manageable. The site speed affects all users, so good call prioritizing it."*

**User**: "Refresh my focus" (after ticking off 2 completed tasks)
**Cursor**: *"I see you completed the user interview analysis and email processing! Let me update those in your source files (marking the analysis complete and updating the email processing routine's last updated date) and generate a fresh focus for the rest of your day."*

**User**: "I need to start tracking a new initiative for the mobile app redesign"
**Cursor**: *Helps user copy from knowledge/initiatives/_template.md and guides them to fill it out*

**User**: "We just completed the design phase!"
**Cursor**: *Updates initiative file to mark task as complete and offers: "Great! Want me to refresh your focus with the next phase priorities?"*

## Proactive Automation
The AI should **automatically** perform these actions without being asked:
- **When user asks about priorities**: Generate intelligent Today's Focus with reasoning
- **Before generating new focus**: Preserve any completed tasks by updating source files
- **When user completes milestones**: Update source files and offer to refresh focus
- **When user seems overwhelmed**: Offer to help prioritize and focus
- **When focus seems outdated**: Suggest refreshing based on new context
