## 🎯 Core Concept

This system is designed around the principle that effective task management requires **relationships** but shouldn't be overwhelming. We keep it simple while maintaining the connections that matter:

- **Initiatives** - focused work streams with clear progress tracking
- **People** - team members, their strengths, and development focus  
- **Routines** - recurring activities that keep things running smoothly
- **Customers** - customer relationships, status, and action items
- **Scratch** - flexible capture spaces for on-the-fly tasks, ideas, and meeting notes (create as needed)


All of this is consolidated into a single **todo.md dashboard** that shows you everything at a glance while keeping rich detail in source files.

## 🚀 How It Works

### **Strategic Daily Focus Approach** 🎯
This system follows a **source-first, focus-driven approach**:
- **Work happens in simple source files** (`knowledge/initiatives/`, `knowledge/people/`, `knowledge/routines/`, `knowledge/customers/`, `knowledge/scratch/`)
- **todo.md is your strategic daily focus** - 3-5 intelligent priorities with reasoning
- **Templates are deliberately simple** to encourage usage over perfection
- **Daily priorities generated by AI** based on urgency, impact, and context
- **Focus is negotiable**: "What should I focus on today?" then "adjust my focus"
- **Progress is preserved**: Tick boxes freely, AI updates source files when refreshing focus
- **Privacy-first**: Your personal `todo.md` stays private (see example below for structure)

### **Just Talk to Cursor** 💬
This system is fully **agentic** - you don't need to learn commands or remember syntax. Just tell Cursor what you want in natural language:

**"Track progress on mobile app redesign initiative"**
→ Cursor opens the initiative file and helps you update progress

**"Show me my current workload"**
→ Cursor syncs your dashboard to show your current situation

**"Update John Smith's development goals"**
→ Cursor opens John's person file and helps you update it

**"Archive my completed tasks"**
→ Cursor moves completed items to the archive automatically

**"Update my email processing routine"**
→ Cursor opens the routine file and helps you update it

**"Show me my current routine schedule"**
→ Cursor generates a report showing all your routines and their schedules

**"What are my current risks and blockers?"**
→ Cursor syncs todo.md dashboard showing risks section with current blockers

**"Show me recent wins and achievements"**
→ Cursor syncs todo.md dashboard showing wins section with achievements

**"Sync my todo dashboard"**
→ Cursor refreshes todo.md with latest action items, risks, and wins from all source files

## 📋 Natural Language Workflows

### Daily Management
Instead of manual commands, just tell Cursor:
- *"Show me what I should focus on today"*
- *"Add a new task to review the quarterly report"*
- *"Mark the API documentation as completed"*
- *"What's my current status?"*

### Initiative Management
Simply say:
- *"Update the website redesign initiative status"*
- *"What initiatives are currently active?"*
- *"Add some progress to [initiative name]"*
- *"Show me initiative progress"*

### People Management
Just ask:
- *"Update [person name]'s development goals"*
- *"What are [person name]'s strengths?"*
- *"Add a task for [person name]"*
- *"Show me [person name]'s progress"*

### Customer Management
Simply say:
- *"Update [customer name]'s relationship status"*
- *"Add a task for [customer name]"*
- *"Show me [customer name]'s current challenges"*
- *"What's our value proposition for [customer name]?"*



### Routine Management
Ask Cursor:
- *"Show me my routine schedule"*
- *"Update my email processing routine"*
- *"Add routine reminders to today's tasks"*
- *"Help me optimize my routines"*

### Scratch & Capture
Tell Cursor:
- *"Create a new scratch file for this month"*
- *"Add a quick task to my scratch file"*
- *"I need to capture some meeting notes"*
- *"Help me process my scratch items"*
- *"Move this idea to a proper initiative file"*
- *"Organize my scratch items"*

### Dashboard Management
Tell Cursor:
- *"Sync my todo dashboard"*
- *"Refresh my todo list"*
- *"Show me my current risks and blockers"*
- *"What wins should I celebrate this week?"*
- *"Update my dashboard with latest changes"*
- *"Show me aggregated action items"*

## 🧠 Intelligent Features

### **Context Awareness**
Cursor understands the relationships between:
- Tasks and their associated initiatives
- People and their development needs
- Routines and their scheduling requirements
- Customers and their relationship status
- Deadlines and priorities
- **All consolidated in one unified dashboard**

### **Proactive Suggestions**
Cursor will:
- Suggest updating related files when you make changes
- Recommend archiving completed tasks
- Suggest when routines are due based on frequency
- Automatically sync dashboard when source files are updated
- Help maintain consistency across files

### **Smart Automation**
Behind the scenes, Cursor:
- Uses appropriate templates for new files
- Maintains proper file naming conventions
- Updates cross-references automatically
- Keeps metadata consistent
- Tracks routine completion and scheduling
- **Consolidates everything into one unified dashboard automatically**

## 🎯 Getting Started

### First Time Setup
1. **Check the example**: Look at the AI-generated focus example below to understand the structure
2. **Ask Cursor**: *"Check if my todo system is working properly"*
3. **Request**: *"Show me my current system status"*
4. **Generate your first focus**: *"What should I focus on today?"*

### Daily Use
1. **Morning**: *"What should I focus on today?"* (AI generates intelligent priorities)
2. **Throughout the day**: Tick off completed tasks as you go
3. **Refresh when needed**: *"Refresh my focus"* (AI preserves completed work and generates new priorities)
4. **Evening**: Review progress in source files

### Weekly Review
1. **Status check**: *"Show me my current status"*
2. **Maintenance**: *"Update people progress"*
3. **Archive**: *"Archive my completed tasks"*

## 📋 Example AI-Generated Focus

Here's what your `todo.md` looks like when AI generates your strategic daily focus:

```markdown
# Today's Focus 🎯

*Generated: 2025-07-05*

## Your Strategic Priorities for Today

- [ ] Complete user interview analysis for mobile app redesign
  *From: mobile-app-redesign.md | Why: Due today, blocks design phase | Context: 5 interviews completed, need synthesis before team meeting*

- [ ] Review Sarah's technical presentation before 2 PM meeting
  *From: sarah-johnson.md | Why: Time-sensitive, supports her promotion goal | Context: Leadership review meeting scheduled, she's nervous and needs feedback*

- [ ] Finalize API documentation for Q1 launch
  *From: website-refresh.md | Why: Developer team blocked without specs | Context: Backend team waiting, affects sprint planning tomorrow*

- [ ] Email Processing (Monday routine)
  *From: email-processing.md | Why: Monday routine, foundation for other work | Context: Inbox at 47 messages, includes client responses*

- [ ] Follow up on Acme Corp contract renewal
  *From: acme-corp.md | Why: Contract expires next week, at-risk status | Context: Need to address their pricing concerns before renewal deadline*

- [ ] Schedule team retrospective for website project
  *From: website-refresh.md | Why: Project wrapping up, team feedback needed | Context: Good timing while project is fresh, before next sprint starts*

---
*This focus is AI-generated from your source files. Say "adjust my focus" to negotiate these priorities.*
```

**Key Features:**
- **3-5 strategic priorities** intelligently selected from all your source files
- **Clear reasoning** for each item: source file, why chosen, and context
- **Balanced mix** of initiatives, people development, routines, customer management, and scratch items
- **Negotiable** - you can adjust the focus through natural conversation
- **Progress preserved** - tick boxes freely, AI updates source files when refreshing

## 🔧 Customization

### Growing the System
As you get comfortable, ask Cursor to:
- *"Add a section to track initiative budgets"*
- *"Help me organize my existing files better"*
- *"Add fields I'm missing in my people files"*

### Keeping It Simple
The system focuses on what matters:
- *"Help me update my existing initiatives"*
- *"How do I track someone's development?"*
- *"Show me how to use the routine tracking"*

## 💡 Best Practices

### **Start Simple**
- Copy templates to set up your first initiative files
- Add people files when you need to track their development
- Set up routine files only for things you actually do regularly

### **Natural Communication**
- Talk to Cursor like a colleague: "I need to track X"
- Focus on what you want to achieve, not how
- Ask for help when you're unsure

### **Grow Gradually**
- Use the system for a week before adding complexity
- Let Cursor suggest improvements based on your patterns
- Add fields to templates only when you need them

### **Consistent Task Formatting**
**ALL tasks across all files must follow this format:**
- **Main tasks**: `- [ ] [Task description]`
- **Subtasks**: Use additional indentation:
  ```markdown
  - [ ] Main task description
    - [ ] Subtask 1
    - [ ] Subtask 2
  ```
- **Completed tasks**: Mark with `[x]` instead of `[ ]`
- **Apply everywhere**: initiatives, people, routines, customers, and scratch files

### **Scratch File Strategies**
**Create scratch files based on your needs:**
- **Single file**: `general.md` - One universal capture space
- **Monthly files**: `2025-01.md`, `2025-02.md` - Rolling monthly capture
- **By context**: `work-persona.md`, `personal.md` - Separate contexts
- **By project**: `mobile-app.md`, `website.md` - Project-specific capture
- **Just copy the template** and name it whatever makes sense for you!

## 🚀 System Philosophy

This system is designed to **grow with you**:
- **Start simple** - basic templates you'll actually use
- **Add complexity gradually** - as you discover what you need
- **Stay focused** - dashboard shows what matters today
- **Trust the process** - let Cursor handle the tedious parts

## 🧠 Cursor Integration

This system is fully optimized for Cursor:
- **Intelligent understanding** of your initiative structure
- **Proactive automation** based on natural language
- **Context-aware suggestions** for better productivity
- **Seamless maintenance** without manual intervention
